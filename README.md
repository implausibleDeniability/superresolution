# Image Super-Resolution
The goal of this project is to research possible super-resolution methods, determine the most effective model for X-Ray medical imaging and evaluate this model 

SRCNN, ESPCNN, EDSR and MDSR (multiscale EDSR), RCAN and MRCAN (multiscale RCAN), and a Sharpening Module are implemented here

Models were trained on two datasets, `div2k` dataset for widespread image-resolution problem, and a group of several chest x-rays datasets for medical image super-resolution problem. All results, concerned medical imaging are removed due to NDA.

## Results
![Models comparison](images/building_low.png)
High-resolution image is in `div2k/results/models_comparison.png`

You can find the example of models application in **example.ipynb**

## Model description
SRCNN and ESPCNN represent the first generation of super-resolution models and have comparably low efficiency

EDSR and RCAN, as well as their multiscale analogues have much more complex structure and higher efficiency

Sharpening Module is a block, which can be applied for edge sharpening. It is not a network, usually it reduces metrics, but in some cases it could improve perceptual quality.

## Metrics
We evaluate the efficiency of models using 2 metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM)
